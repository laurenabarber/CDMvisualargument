I chose to make my visual argument target parents or legal guardians who are addicted to opioids. I wanted to make it clear how their use could lead to traumatic events such as finding the O.D. on the floor of their home. It's a very dark message, but with certain subjects like drugs, many choose to use this scared straight tactic to make an impact. I wanted there to be a large contrast between the font and background to help the message stand out. I also made use of blank space to then have only the users arm and their child's foot distinctly in frame. This again makes the message more clear.
